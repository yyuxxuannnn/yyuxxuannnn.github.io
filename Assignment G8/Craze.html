                        <h5 class="mb-4"><p>The term “sandbox” may be more recognizable from its usage in tech or even as an open-ended mode available within certain games. It’s often associated with player choice, open environments, and non-linear gameplay.</p>
						<p>Players often have less concrete goals and narrative pathways to pursue. Instead of beating the boss and saving the princess, you may face a variety of tasks you can accomplish in a number of different ways.</p>
						<p>Simulation games like <strong>The Sims</strong> are also increasingly touted as sandbox titles, as are many popular franchises, including both <strong>Minecraft</strong> and <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong>.</a></p></h5>

                        <h5 class="mb-4"><p>It’s impossible to overstate how enjoyable RTS games can be. There are few things as satisfying as building up an immense army and simply washing over your foes like a river over stones, erasing their existence as effortlessly as a click.</p>
						<p>In the archetypal RTS title, Dune II human and AI players control different factions and compete against each other simultaneously in “real time” hence the term “real-time strategy,” as opposed to turn-based strategy. These games typically include resource and map management, and they often feature a top-down view.</p>
						<p><strong>Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Age of Empires</strong> and <strong>Shadow Tactics</strong>are also increasingly touted as sandbox titles, as are many popular franchises, including both <strong>Minecraft</strong> and <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong>.</a></p></h5>

						<p>An FPS simulates a typical human viewpoint, showing essentially what your in-game character sees in franchises like <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, <strong>Call of Duty</strong> and <strong>Valorant.</strong>
						<p>A TPS pulls the perspective back and showcases your entire character and surrounding environment, such as in the <strong>Gears of War</strong> and <strong>Tom Clancy's The Division</strong> series.</a></p></h5>

						<p>Sports games have expanded in variety, offering full-fledged partnerships with major sporting organizations, from race tracks to the field or court. <strong>NBA 2K</strong> and <strong>Madden NFL</strong> are two well-known examples that feature detailed recreations of professional basketball and football, while <strong>Forza</strong> is a simulation-style car racing game.</p>

						<p>Puzzlers, also known as puzzle games, can be as simple as <strong>Minesweeper</strong> or more deeply immersive, with fully developed environments and hybrid gameplay. <strong>The Tomb Raider</strong> series is a good example, where puzzles are built into a conventional adventure narrative and setting, making them a key game mechanic.</p>

As a result, many games can fit into this category, including the classic <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> franchise that paved the way for numerous franchises.</p>
						Released in late 2019, <strong>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</strong> is another well-received action-adventure title from the folks at Respawn, who previously worked on the Titanfall series. Other more modern examples include the <strong>Watch Dogs</strong> series, <strong>Sekiro</strong>, and the <strong>Arkham</strong> games.</a></p></h5>

                        <h5 class="mb-4"><p>The core mechanics of a survival game centers on resource management, often incorporating crafting or salvage systems that you can use to help keep your character alive. <strong>Minecraft</strong> is a popular standout, as is <strong>Don’t Starve</strong>. And then there are games like The Long Dark, which focuses entirely on survival elements with a dedicated mode that increases difficulty.</p>
						<p>Horror is an even broader category, arguably encompassing dozens of survival titles. Almost anything with zombies, a post-apocalyptic storyline, or loads of jump scares is considered horror. These titles are often psychological, too, and use tension to immerse the player in the game.</p>
						<p>On the pure horror side, you have games like <strong>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</strong>, <strong>Alien: Isolation</strong>, <strong>and Blair Witch</strong>. However, the most popular horror titles tend to fall into the survival-horror side of things, such as the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> and <strong>Evil Within</strong> franchises.</a></p></h5>
