					<p>In 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major “crash” due to a number of factors, including an oversaturated
						game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games.

					<p>In 1989, Nintendo made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit Game Boy video game device and the 
						often-bundled game Tetris.
