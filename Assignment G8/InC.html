				<h2><u>Criminal Activity, Online safety and Cybersecurity</u></h2>
					<p>Online casino scams, phishing, mobile phone dialers, malware in unlawful downloads, and money laundering are all typical occurrences in games. Others have discovered methods to benefit illegally from built-in mechanisms, most notably the usage of skin gambling in games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, 
					which highlighted how in-game virtual objects could be leveraged to gamble for real-world money.
					</p>
					
					<p>Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting players. Cybercriminals target video game users in order to steal their credentials, 
					ID, or data, as well as payment card information or money from their accounts. Attacking players is motivated in part by the fact that they are 
					perceived as a honeypot (they have something worth taking), a relatively vulnerable target (since many are young individuals or children), and some 
					of their behaviors enhance the likelihood of being attacked (social behavior, accessing cheats, downloading and sharing free games). In January 2021, 
					cybersecurity experts discovered over a million hacked business accounts of gaming firms, indicating that the gamers themselves are not always the target 
					of attacks.</p>

				<h2><u>Violence</u></h2>
					<p>Since their beginnings, video games have been a source of controversy owing to the portrayals of violence they may include, 
					a problem that has only grown as the technology behind them improves the degree of visual detail and realism of games. 
					Although video games are frequently blamed for violent acts, particularly in the aftermath of the Columbine High School tragedy in 1999, 
					academic research have yet to provide convincing evidence tying video game violence to violent conduct.
					</p>
					
					<p>Despite the lack of strong evidence and scholarly consensus, politicians and activists have pushed to limit the sale of violent video games, 
					especially to children, on the grounds that they can lead to violent conduct.  The formation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board in 1994 and the 
					2011 Supreme Court of the United States landmark case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, which ruled that video games are a protected class 
					of free speech and blocked legislation on such sales restrictions, respectively, in the United States.</p>

				<h2><u>Gaming Culture and Cyberbullying</u></h2>
					<p>Along with its predominantly youthful, male-dominated community, gamers may show habits and behaviors that are perceived as toxic and sexist by 
					outside groups, resulting in harassment of other players. Xbox Live services provide a specific example of harassing conduct occurring within a game. 
					Because of its online chat and party structure, the service is vulnerable to unwelcome harassment, trolling, or bullying from other users. 
					Microsoft improved the reputation tiers for a player's Xbox Live account to address these issues. The approach is geared up to warn about poor behavior 
					before punishing it in the goal of better controlling Xbox Live accounts.
					</p>
					
					<p>The internet's anonymity may have a role in fostering antisocial conduct. This sort of behavior extends beyond gaming to other areas of the internet, 
					such as online forums, social networking sites, and so on. The lack of accountability for one's conduct on the internet may incite others to harass you. 
					Some people may find it simpler to engage in undesirable conduct when gaming online if there is no possibility of penalty. The Gamergate incident, 
					which began in 2014, attracted public attention to the bad aspects of the video gaming community's culture, emphasizing the need to combat online abuse.</p>

				<h2><u>Cheating</u></h2>
					<p>Players have almost always been able to cheat in video games. Players would find secret cheat codes in games typically left as testing codes by the 
					developer (such as the Konami code that would give them numerous lives or other bonuses), or there were devices that could edit a game cartridge's memory 
					on the fly, such as the Game Genie, which had little impact on other players and was considered innocuous. Trainers were frequently created by players to 
					expand possibilities and provide extra hacks for games on more advanced personal computers. These tricks would allow players to finish games without giving 
					them any further advantages.
					</p>
					
					<p>Similar methods of profiting financially from video games are related to cheating. Gold farming, which involves paying low-income laborer to level 
					characters or acquire in-game stuff that may subsequently be sold to other players for a profit, and twinking or smurfing, which involves paying competent 
					players to level low-level characters rapidly.</p>
